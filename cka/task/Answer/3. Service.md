## Service

1. Create a Service named `myapp` of type `ClusterIP` that exposes port 80 and maps to the target port 80.

        $ vim clusterip.yaml

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: myapp
          labels:
            app: myapp
        spec:
          type: ClusterIP
          ports:
          - protocol: TCP
            port: 80
            targetPort: 80
          selector:
              app: myapp

2. Create a Deployment named `myapp` that creates 1 replica running the image `nginx:1.23.4-alpine`. Expose the container port 80.

        $ vim deploy.yaml

    Here is a YAML file to create the Deployement with one replicas service
        
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: myapp
          labels:
            app: myapp
        spec:
          replicas: 1
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: myapp
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: myapp
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: nginx
                image: nginx:1.26.1-alpine
                containerPort: 80

3. Scale the Deployment to 2 replicas.

       $ kubectl scale deployment myapp --replicas=2

4. Create a temporary Pod using the image busybox and run a wget command against the IP of the service.

            First letâ€™s create a Temporary BusyBox Pod:

            $ kubectl run busybox --rm -it --image=busybox -- /bin/sh
    
            Once we are inside a pod, now it is time to Run the wget Command Inside the Pod:

            $ wget -qO- myapp

5. Run a wget command against the service outside the cluster.

        In order to test the service outside of the cluster we need to have the cluster Ip. to see the the cluster Ip use the below command:-

        $ kubectl get svc myapp

        Then run the below command to test the service outside of the cluster

         wget -qO- <ClusterIP>

         Note: This will not work because ClusterIP is only accessible within the cluster.


6. Change the service type so the Pods can be reached outside the cluster.

       $ kubectl patch service myapp -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'


7. Then Run wget Using the NodePort:

        Check the Node IP of the  Pod

        $  kubectl describe node myapp-xxx

        From Windos PC access myapp using browser/wget/curl 
    
        $  -wget -qO- <NodeIP>:<NodePort>
        $  -curl <NodeIP>:<NodePort>
